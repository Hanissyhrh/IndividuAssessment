<center> <h3>  GALERI PANTAI TIMUR </h3></center>

<center> <p> After my SPM, i worked as a secretary at Galeri Pantai Timur in Kuantan. It was belong to my mom's friend. I just need <br>
to handle the paintings, events, meetings and keep the place clean. I also learn on how to draw a potrait step by step and <br>
learn more detail about the painting. I got to know a lot of things from my bos also the other artist that came to the <br>
gallery and teach me this and that. I am so grateful because I gain a new knowledge eventhough I am more interesting in <br>
doodles compare to potrait. At least I know the basic so that I can practice more during my leisure time. Sometimes it <br>
quite scary when you were left alone with the paintings because it do feels like the picture was staring at you. Overall, it was <br> 
the best working experiences ever. </p> </center>

<center> <h3>  EVENT MANAGEMENT </h3></center>

<center> <p> During my degree in Semester 1 in Machang, I am the Project Manager for one of the event that have been organized by <br>
Management Subject, under the surveillance of Madam Zaleha Hassan. It was the combination between two classes which <br> 
is BA249 and BA242. The program was amazing and everyone do play their role to make the event more enjoyable and <br> 
fun. We open the event to other classes as well so they can come and visited our booth. We do have a lot of booth with <br> 
different kind of activities and games. This event taught us to managed the booth perfectly and how to make a great team <br> 
work with others. It was one of the most memorable moments that we had before we need to flit to Campus Kota Bharu. </p></center>

<center> <h3>  HOMSIS 1.0 </h3></center>

<center> <p> When I am in Kota Bharu, I have been appointed as Secretary 2 in Islamic Banking Association Club or known as IBAC. <br> 
This is one of the programme that I need to handle which is Homsis. During this event, all clubs need to promote their <br> 
clubs to the new students to let them know a little bit about your organization. It takes about 3 to 4 days for us to <br> 
decorate the booth, to prepare everything that is necessary to make sure the students noticed our booth and also for the <br> 
prizes. This event make us know others club members and also get to create new friends. It was one of the enjoyable <br>
moment that we had before Covid came and change everything. But at least, we create the memories with each other. </p></center>
