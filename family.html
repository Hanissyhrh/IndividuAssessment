Now lets meet my siblings! I have 5 siblings and I am the fourth. I have 3 brothers and 1 youngest sister. My brothers not a photo-kind  
of person thats why it just me and my lil sister. Okay, so my brothers, the 3 of them already working and one of them is already married.  
The other two is waiting for their princess to slip off their heels. My brothers which is also my banker will never let us down when it 
comes to money and foods. Anything that we want, they will make it come true. For my youngest sister, she is everything to me. Many  
people said that we are twins, but actually we are not. We share almost everything together including our clothes and shawls. Well,
thats not the best part of having a sister but, its fine.  She is the joker, the doctor, the enemy and everything well, you just named it. 
She knows how to cheer me up, but sometimes she can be so annoying. No matter what, she is the best thing that ever 
happen in my life.</p>
